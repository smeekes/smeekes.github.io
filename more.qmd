### In the Media

* Every year I contribute to the annual question posted by the website [Beste-ID](https://www.beste-id.nl/auteurs/stephan-smeekes).

* My research in 100 seconds: [How to Make Sense of Your Data?](https://umio-prime.nl/how-to-make-sense-of-your-data/)

* In October 2020, Etienne Wijler and I gave an online talk for UMIO in the Afternoon Tea & Talent session [How Smart Is Your Algorithm?](https://umio-prime.nl/how-smart-is-your-algorithm/) Also see the accompanying article [A Taste of Big Data Analysis: Sour Milk or Luxury Ice Cream?](https://umio-prime.nl/a-taste-of-big-data-analysis/).

* In March 2020, I participated in the Dutch popular science TV show Knappe Koppen. In the episode [When will the next economic crisis take place?](https://www.avrotros.nl/knappe-koppen/gemist/detail/item/wanneer-komt-de-volgende-economische-crisis-11-03-2020/) I gave a mini-lecture about economic forecasting and the difficulties that we encounter in the process.[^2]

[^2]: The recording took place in January 2020, before the Covid crisis started to unfold. In hindsight this makes my answer "I have no idea about the next crisis" a bit silly... On the other hand, it does illustrate why predicting crises is so complicated!

* I gave an interview to university newspaper De Observant about spurious correlations. Links to the [Dutch](https://www.observantonline.nl/Home/Artikelen/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/16535/Gevecht-tegen-onzinstatistiek) and [English](https://www.observantonline.nl/English/Home/Articles/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/16536/Fight-against-nonsense-statistics) versions.

* My [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aEsAAM1lqI) (in Dutch) for the [Young Academy](https://www.dejongeakademie.nl/) explains my research in very brief terms.
